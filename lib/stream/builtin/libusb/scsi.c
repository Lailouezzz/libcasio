/* SCSI over USB in libusb uses the Bulk-Only protocol defined here:
 * http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/usbmassbulk_10.pdf
 *
 * CBW (command block wrappers) for USB-attached SCSI Mass Storage,
 * with integer fields using little-endian:
 *
 * - Signature (4B): identify the packet as a CBW.
 *   [0x55, 0x53, 0x42, 0x43] (USBC)
 * - Tag (4B): answerer will echo this field to us in the associated CSW.
 *   Used by BrandonW: [0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44] (ABCD)
 * - Data Transfer Length (4B): â€”
 * - Flags (1B):
 *   - Bit 7 (128): direction, 0 for host to device, 1 for device to host.
 *   - Other bits:  reserved or obsolete, set to zero (0).
 * - LUN (1B): LUN (from 0 to 15).
 * - Command Block Length (1B): (6, 10, 12 or 16).
 * - (Command Descriptor Block content)
 *
 * CSW (command status wrappers) for USB-attached SCSI Mass Storage,
 * with integer fields using little-endian:
 *
 * - Signature (4B): identify the packet as a CSW.
 *   [0x55, 0x53, 0x42, 0x53] (USBS)
 * - Tag (4B): echo the field from the CBW.
 *   Used by BrandonW: [0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44] (ABCD)
 * - Data Residue (4B):
 * - Status (1B): success or failure.
 *   - 0: command passed (good).
 *   - 1: command failed (bad).
 *   - 2: phase error. */
