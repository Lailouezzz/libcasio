This is the libcasio developer documentation.

libcasio ought to become the _de facto_ standard when it comes to manipulating
protocols and file formats used with CASIO calculators. Most of it is
platform-agnostic, although it contains stream and filesystem interfaces with
the most common systems such as Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux distributions
or Apple's OS X.

The C "namespace" the library reserves are `casio_`, `CASIO_`, `libcasio_`
and `LIBCASIO_`; consider the use of anything starting with one of these
prefixes as having an undefined behaviour (so you really shouldn't do that).

There are many objects in libcasio. Choose what fits your need(s) in the
sidebar!
