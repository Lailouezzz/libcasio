p7 - command-line utility to communicate with casio calculators

SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,bash]
----
p7 [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [<command> [<args>]]
----

DESCRIPTION
-----------
p7 is a command-line utility to communicate with machines using casio's
communication protocol 7.00, like (almost only, not gonna lie) CASIO
fx calculators. For now, it only implements file sending/getting functions
on flash memories.

Available submenus are:

*send [-f] [-o oncalc.ext] [-d oncalcdir] local.ext*::
	Send a file to the calculator.
*get [-o local.ext] [-d oncalcdir] oncalc.ext*::
	Get a file from calculator.
*copy [-d sourcedir] [-t destdir] source.ext dest.ext*::
	Copies a file into another on the calculator.
*del [-d oncalcdir] oncalc.ext*::
	Delete a file on the calculator.
*ls*::
	List files on the calculator.
*reset*::
	Reset a filesystem on the calculator.
*optimize*::
	Optimize the distant filesystem (defragment).
*info*::
	Dumps information about the calculator.

OPTIONS
-------
Options start with one or two dashes. Some of the options require an additional
value next to them.

*-h, --help*::
	Display command/subcommand help page and quit.
*-v, --version*::
	Display version and quit.
*--com <device>*::
	The serial device, if you want to communicate with a calculator connected
	using a USB-to-serial cable.
 ::
	If this option isn't used, the program will look for a calculator connected
	using direct USB.
*--storage abc0*::
	The storage device with which to interact.
*--no-term, --no-exit*::
	Do not terminate connection when action is completed.
*--no-start, --no-init*::
	Do not initialize connection -- should only be used when
	*--no-term*/*--no-exit*	was used last time p7 was called.
*-d DIR, --directory=DIR*::
	The on-calc directory to work in.
	Default for this option is device root.
*-t DDIR, --to=DIR*::
	The destination directory (for file copying/moving).
	Default for this option is device root.
*-o OUT, --output=OUT*::
	For the *get* subcommand, the local file path to store in the output (or
	'-' for stdout). For the *send* subcommand, the distant filename. For the
	two subcommands, default is adapted from the input parameter.
*-f, --force*::
	For the *send* subcommand, force overwrite (default is interactive
	confirmation from user).
*-#*::
	Displays a nice little loading bar for *send* and *get* subcommands. If
	command is *get* and output is stdout, loading bar won't be displayed.
