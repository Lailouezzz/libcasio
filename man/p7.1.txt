p7 - command-line utility to communicate with casio calculators

SYNOPSIS
--------
[source,bash]
----
p7 [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [<command> [<args>]]
----

DESCRIPTION
-----------
p7 is a command-line utility to communicate with machines using casio's
communication protocol 7.00, like (almost only, not gonna lie) CASIO
fx calculators. For now, it only implements file sending/getting functions
on flash memories.

Available submenus are:

*send [-f] [-o oncalc.ext] [-d oncalcdir] local.ext*::
	Send a file to the calculator.
*get [-o local.ext] [-d oncalcdir] oncalc.ext*::
	Get a file from calculator.
*copy [-d sourcedir] [-t destdir] source.ext dest.ext*::
	Copies a file into another on the calculator.
*del [-d oncalcdir] oncalc.ext*::
	Delete a file on the calculator.
*ls*::
	List files on the calculator.
*reset*::
	Reset a filesystem on the calculator.
*optimize*::
	Optimize the distant filesystem (defragment).
*info*::
	Dumps information about the calculator.

OPTIONS
-------
Options start with one or two dashes. Some of the options require an additional
value next to them.

*-h, --help*::
	Display command/subcommand help page and quit.
*-v, --version*::
	Display version and quit.
*--com <device>*::
	The serial device, if you want to communicate with a calculator connected
	using a USB-to-serial cable.
 ::
	If this option isn't used, the program will look for a calculator connected
	using direct USB.
*--use <settings>*::
	If a serial connexion is used, tells p7 to use the given settings, which
	are of the format <speed><parity><stop bits>, e.g. 9600N2.
*--set <settings>*::
	If a serial connexion is used, tells p7 to make an agreement with the
	calculator to change the connexion settings to the given one. If different
	from the default settings and not exiting, the next call to p7 or any
	other similar utility will have to be called with the *--use* option.
*--reset*::
	Same as *--set*, except that the settings are set to be the default
	ones for the protocol.
*--storage abc0*::
	The storage device with which to interact.
*--no-term, --no-exit*::
	Do not terminate connection when action is completed.
*--no-start, --no-init*::
	Do not initialize connection -- should only be used when
	*--no-term*/*--no-exit*	was used last time p7 was called.
*-d DIR, --directory=DIR*::
	The on-calc directory to work in.
	Default for this option is device root.
*-t DDIR, --to=DIR*::
	The destination directory (for file copying/moving).
	Default for this option is device root.
*-o OUT, --output=OUT*::
	For the *get* subcommand, the local file path to store in the output (or
	'-' for stdout). For the *send* subcommand, the distant filename. For the
	two subcommands, default is adapted from the input parameter.
*-f, --force*::
	For the *send* subcommand, force overwrite (default is interactive
	confirmation from user).
*-#*::
	Displays a nice little loading bar for *send* and *get* subcommands. If
	command is *get* and output is stdout, loading bar won't be displayed.
