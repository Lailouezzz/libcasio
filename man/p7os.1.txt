DESCRIPTION
-----------
p7os is a command-line utility to get and upload an OS on CASIO fx calculators,
using its communication protocol 7.00 and OS update mode.

Available submenus are :

*prepare-only*::
	Sends the update program, but leave it for other programs to interact
	with it.
*get [-o os.bin]*::
	Backup the bootcode, CASIOWIN entry and OS.

You have to *prepare* before doing any other action. Preparing means sending
a P7 server on the calculator that will be able to execute commands required
by other subcommands.

OPTIONS
-------
Options start with one or two dashes. Some of the options require an additional
value next to them.

*-h, --help*::
	Display command/subcommand help page and quit.
*-v, --version*::
	Display version and quit.
*--com <device>*::
	The serial device, if you want to communicate with a calculator connected
	using a USB-to-serial cable.
 ::
	If this option isn't used, the program will look for a calculator connected
	using direct USB.
*--no-prepare*::
	Use the current environment, instead of uploading one.
*--uexe <path>*::
	Use a custom update program.
*-o OUT, --output=OUT*::
	When getting something, where to store.
