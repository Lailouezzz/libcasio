/* The active side starts by sending a header (starting with 0x3A, ':').
 * The passive side then answers with either an ACK (0x06), or
 * an overwrite error (0x21) if the file already exists.
 *
 * If we, as te active side, are in an overwrite confirmation situation,
 * we can either send an ABORT (0x15) to not overwrite, or an ACK if it
 * accepts. If we have something else than an ACK after the overwrite
 * confirmation, then this means that the passive side cannot overwrite.
 *
 * Once the header is accepted, the active side sends the header data parts
 * and the data parts corresponding to the headers.
 *
 * For the headers or (headers) data parts, there is a checksum. If this
 * checksum isn't right, the passive side asks the header/part again, with
 * the 0x2B error. If the header data type is unknown, the passive side
 * sends 0x24 (or 0x00?). If the header has some errors, the passive side
 * sends 0x51, and the transfer aborts. */
