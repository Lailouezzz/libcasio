/* Storage backup files (G1S) contain backups of the storage memory.
 * It corresponds exactly to the on-calc storage memory structure.
 *
 * According to Simon Lothar, the files contain zeroes up to 0x00270000
 * (this is the mapped location of the SMEM in real fx-9860 calculators),
 * then it has the same structure than the one used by the calculator.
 *
 * These files are not managed by the calculator directly; however, they
 * are managed by FA-124. */

/* ---
 * Directory list.
 * --- */

/* The SMEM (content of the G1S file once 0x270000 bytes were skipped) starts
 * with a big entry list. An entry is 32-bytes long: it starts with a common
 * part, then with a type-specific part (then unused bytes if the subheader
 * is less than 28-bytes long). Here is its structure: */

typedef struct casio_storage_entry_s {
	/* the type number - see below */
	casio_uint16_t casio_storage_entry_type;

	/* the number of the entry; if this field is 0x00, just ignore the entry.
	 * we don't know why entries with this field set to 0x00 exist...
	 * (probably backups?) */
	casio_uint16_t casio_storage_entry_id;

	/* the raw subheader */
	casio_uint8_t  casio_storage_entry_raw_subheader[28];
} casio_storage_entry_t;

/* The `type` is composed of three nibbles of identification (`type & 0xFFF`)
 * and a (high) nibble of special properties, keep that in mind.
 * Here are the known types: */

# define storage_entrytype_directory  0x110
# define storage_entrytype_file       0x120
# define storage_entrytype_fragment   0x130
# define storage_entrytype_sector     0x200

/* The special nibble is usually zero when deleted, and non-zero when active.
 * According to Simon Lothar, this is because it is possible to clear bits
 * on the flash by flashwriting a short value only; but when it comes to
 * set bits, it becomes more tricky.
 *
 * This is also why optimizing is not done straight away (to save the flash
 * a little).
 *
 * The list can contain up to 0x800 entries, and occupies the first sector.
 * Simon Lothar says the list can expand to the second sector (which is used
 * only if there is no space in the index sector or the other data sectors).
 * Entries with the 0xFFFF type should not be read.
 *
 * Some entry types can have parents. In this case, they have parent type,
 * and parent number fields. This is because elements with different types
 * follow different numerations; so the type field is here on which numeration
 * to search for the member. If the parent type is 0xFFFF (or -1, as some say),
 * then there is no parent.
 *
 * For now, only directories as parents for files have been encountered. */

/* ---
 * Sectors.

/* Sectors represent the physical sectors of the storage memory (space!).
 * They are 64 KiB large.
 *
 * Simon Lothar says that there are 27 entries for them (or 14 on the AU models
 * because of australian exam regulations). If the logical number
 * is 0xFFFFFFFF, the sector is unused. (sometimes the logical number field
 * contains gibberish, I don't know why yet)
 *
 * Their special nibble is either 0x04 or 0x00, the signification of it is not
 * known to me yet. Here is their subheader structure: */

	 *	not be set as parent nodes :) */

} casio_storage_sector_t;

/* ---
 * Directories.

 *

 * Fragments are in fact links to the sectors, with some more information.
 *
 * Their special nibble have the same meaning that for files... but are not
 * always accurate, so only check on files!
 *
 * The first fragment corresponding to a file contain this file's type,
 * probably detected when the file is transferred/created/whatever. Here are
