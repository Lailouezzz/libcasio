/* See `libcasio/format.h` for general information about what the CASIOLINK
 * format is.
 *
 * The CASIOLINK file format is linked to how the legacy (CAS) protocol works:
 * one-byte packets are sent between the two machines (for initiating
 * communication, ACKing, NAKing, ...), unless the sent/receiving byte is
 * the double-colon ':' (0x3A) -- then it is the beginning of something
 * that is more than one-byte long. CAS files do not include the one-byte
 * packets, or repeated headers/parts (because of bad checksum or timeouts,
 * for example) -- see the legacy protocol documentation for this.
 *
 * Actually, there are three main things that start with a ':'. The main type
 * is a header, that describes the content that follows. A content can have
 * no data part (e.g. END packet), one data part (e.g. programs), or
 * more (e.g. width*height content parts for lists and matrixes, which
 * represent the individual cells). These content parts have different formats
 * according to the global content part.
 *
 * But I told you there were three things. The third is a little subtle:
 * one header can correspond to several contents. Then we have what we
 * call the CAS file*s* part (or heads part).
 * An example is 'FN' (set of editor files): we receive the main head,
 * with the count of editor files that are sent to us, then we receive one part
 * indicating the size of each files, then for each file, we receive one part,
 * which is the file content.
 *
 * We have one protocol, the CASIOLINK protocol (also called 'legacy protocol'
 * in the libcasio scope), but we have two different type of headers. The two
 * have a fixed width, so they are named by the number of bytes they occupy.
 * Notice that, for what I know, content formats don't vary between header
 * types. The checksuming technique neither. */
